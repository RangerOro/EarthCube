# EarthCube
EarthCube is my Minecraft server, it features plugins like [Towny](https://github.com/TownyAdvanced/Towny), [mcMMO](https://mcmmo.fandom.com/wiki/McMMO_Wiki) and some other fun addons!

You will be able to create towns and nations in a 1:750 scaled Earth map.
But also you could create organizations, like sport leagues, gambling clubs, or everything you want. Cool!
